                    <p>Hi! I am a student and I am about to start a bachelor degree in software engineering at Laval
                        university in Québec city, Qc, Canada. I am very excited to learn more about coding and computer
                        science. I have already started to explore and to learn the basics. You are looking right
                        now at my first coding project, my GitHub profile's website.

                    <p>Previously, I studied biomedical sciences. Although I decided not to continue in this field,
                        I had the opportunity to have very enriching experiences about health and research. I had the
                        chance to work and have an internship in a research lab at the university's medical school
                        and I worked in a drugstore as a technical assistant. Considering that I don't have any
                        programming projects yet, I publishes on this site some of the accomplishments I have
                        made during my previous years of study.

                <td>
                    <p>I also have a great interest in graphic arts and would like to learn more about design.
                        I have mostly done illustration and drawing but I have also dabbled in several other mediums,
                        such as calligraphy, inking and watercolor. I have already done several small scale projects,
                        including all the llustrations that are posted on this website. I also do photography, edit
                        pictures and videos on my computer in my spare time.
